# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

The FAA dataset for this project provides a large amount of information regarding the reported wildlife strikes from year 2000 to 2015. The main numerical data that we will be exploring are the cost of damage and the frequency of wildlife strikes. We will also be studying three categorical variables which are the effect to the aircrafts, the time when the incidents took place and the location (origin state).

The main goal of this project is to create a data visualization dashboard to display the relationships between the mentioned variables. 


## Process

1. Explore the relationships by building multiple visualizations. 

Bar Chart
Effect: Amount of Damage VS Total Damage Cost & Frequency of Wildlife Strikes
Effect: Impact to Flight VS Total Damage Cost & Frequency of Wildlife Strikes
When: Time of Day VS Total Damage Cost
When: Phase of Flight VS Total Damage Cost 
Frequency of Strike Over Time
Total Damage Cost Over Time

Choropleth
Total Damage Cost per State
Cost-Strike Ratio per State

2. Formulate questions that can be answered using the data. 
3. Extract important patterns and trends to answer the questions. 
4. Dive deeper and question unusual phenomenon.  


## Results


1. Substantial damages cost the most money (Effect: Amount of Damage VS Total Damage Cost)
- Looking at the ratio (cost / frequency), destroyed air vessels cost 10 times more 

2. Precautionary landings cost the most money (Effect: Impact to Flight VS Total Damage Cost)
- Again, looking at the ratio, Engine Shut Down cost 8 times more per strike 

3. Most of the accidents happened during the day (When: Time of Day VS Total Damage Cost)
- Make sense because there were more flights during the day, hence a higher chance to encounter a wildlife strike

4. Accidents that happened during the climbing phase contributes to the highest damage cost (When: Phase of Flight VS Total Damage Cost)
- Groundwork for further research: what is it about the climbing phase that exposes the air crafts to such high chance of damage?

5. New York has the highest Total Damage Cost (Total Damage Cost per State)
- Make sense because it is one of the most, or probably the busiest city in the US

6. Alabama has the highest Cost per Strike (Cost-Strike Rato per State)
- With only 279 strikes (13% of New York's strikes), the damage cost for each strike averages around $51K 

7. Steady increase in frequency of wildlife strikes throughtout the 15 years (Frequency of Strike Over Time)
- Q3 always has the highest count

8. Total Damage Cost seems to stay constant throughout the years (Total Damage Cost over Time)
- Spike in 2009 Q1 


The above is just a quick summary of the results obtained from the visualizations. There are a lot more to explore and there are questions that arises throughout that might lay the groundwork for future research. 


## Challenges 

Overloaded with information
- start by sorting out interested variables 

Identifying the bigger picture
- from a business perspective (focus on cost)

Make sense of the numbers/trends
- what do they mean

Find out more in-depth information
- further analysis (cost-strike ratio)

## Future Goals

From the observations obtained, there are multiple areas that we can dive into for future investigations. 

Effect (to the aircrafts)
- study the why & how of the substantial/destroyed cases and make improvements

When (did the strikes happened)
- preventative measures in climbing phase

Location (origin state)
- explore if there are other compounding factors
